PyCity Schools Analysis
The data shows that medium and small schools have a much higher percentage of overall passing grades, while larger schools(2000-5000) have less than 60% overall passing grades. Charter schools showed to have 90% overall passing grades while district schools only had 53% overall passing grades.
When comparing Per Student Budget between charter and district schools, charter schools produced higher grades even with smaller budgets than district schools. This relation can be seen in the spending_summary, the data shows that spending more per student does not increase the overall passing percentage.
